In order to run the application for this project, open two terminal windows. From the root project directoy, execute the following commands to start the server and client respectively:
#### cd nfl/server; npm start
#### cd nfl/client; npm start
Once this is done, a window should launch in your browser containing the application. If it does not, navigate to http://localhost:3000. This will open to the dashboard page.

The four main pages of our application is as follows:
- Dashboard - Dynamically populate the 32 NFL teams and display different categories to filter on
- Hometowns - Passing and rushing stastics based on all or specific home towns
- Players - Records for individual players based on number of years played and performance metrics
- Colleges - Show which colleges have produced the most talented athletes based on different criteria

In order to run this application, make sure that Node is up to date using your package install (pip, brew, or yarn). Additionally, be sure to run npm install in both the server and client folders in order to download all necessary packages.
