In order to run the application for this project, open two terminal windows. From the root project directoy, execute the following commands to start the server and client respectively:
### cd nfl/server; npm start
### cd nfl/client; npm start
then tab one terminal window into the client folder and the other into the server folder. First, run npm start in the server window to launch the server. Then, run npm start in the client window to launch the application. Once this is done, a window should launch in your browser containing the application. This will open to the home page. There are 4 pages to our app:
- A timed single player trivia game (the home screen)
- A multiplayer trivia game
- A page to conduct searches on the database
- A page to lookup players based on their names

There pages can be tabbed between by the dashboard at the top of the page.

In order to run this application, make sure that Node is downgraded to version 15.4. Additionally, be sure to run npm install in both the server and client folders in order to download all necessary packages.
